I have built a dynamic and user-friendly weather application using React. This application allows users to find real-time weather information such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity for any city they search for.

Key Features:
City-Based Weather Search: Users can enter the name of any city to get detailed weather information.
Weather Details: The app displays crucial weather parameters including temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
Synonym Search: The application is designed with an intuitive feature where users can type synonyms of a city name to get the corresponding weather details.
Technologies Used:
React: The core framework for building the user interface, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.
API Integration: The app fetches weather data from a reliable weather API to ensure accuracy and up-to-date information.
CSS: Custom styling to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application.
